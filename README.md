The first is a simple search endpoint that then gives you simple details plus a movie ID and that movie ID is use to get the cast and synopsis. The last is used to get the movie poster which is hosted on a simple endpoint

# Usage

To use this app all you have to type in the movie you want in the search and then boom, the background of the page changes to the movie you typed in. You also get the top 15 cast members and a synopsis of the movie in question.
